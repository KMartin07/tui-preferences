# Gemini CLI Development Environment

This repository provides a standardized development environment for interacting with the Gemini CLI. It simplifies the setup process by providing a Dockerized environment with the Gemini CLI pre-installed, allowing you to quickly get started with your projects.

## Overview

To utilize this repository and the Gemini CLI for your projects, follow these general steps:

1.  **Start the containerized environment:** Launch the Docker container to access the pre-configured Gemini CLI.
2.  **Access the container and clone your project:** Enter the running container and clone your specific project repository into it. The Gemini CLI is already installed within this environment.
3.  **Configure your project with `workflow.md`:** Copy the provided `workflow.md` into your project's root directory within the container, then start the Gemini CLI and run the `/init` command to set up your project's context.

## Getting Started

To use this repository, follow these detailed steps:

### 1. Running the Docker Container

#### Initial Setup

To start the container for the first time, pull the image from the GitHub Container Registry and run it:

```bash
docker run -it --name gemini-dev-container ghcr.io/kmartin07/gemini-dev:latest
```

This command will start the container and attach you to its terminal.

#### Re-entering the Container

If the container is not running, you can start it in the background using the following command:

```bash
docker start gemini-dev-container
```

If the container is running, you can enter it using the following command:

```bash
docker exec -it gemini-dev-container bash
```

### 2. Get API Key

Obtain a free API key from [https://aistudio.google.com/api-keys](https://aistudio.google.com/api-keys).

Set it as an environment variable:
(You can run this command in the shell or paste it to the end of your `~/.bashrc` file for persistence)

```bash
export GEMINI_API_KEY=<your API key>
```

### 3. Initialize Your Project with `workflow.md`

Copy the `workflow.md` file from this repository to the root of your project repository within the container. This file serves as a template for configuring the Gemini CLI.

Then, run the `gemini` command in your container environment:

```bash
gemini
```

Select "Sign in with API key." The CLI will use the `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable you set in the previous step.

Once the Gemini CLI is active, run the `/init` command. The CLI will use `workflow.md` to create a `GEMINI.md` file in your project's root directory.

### 4. Understanding `GEMINI.md`

The `GEMINI.md` file is automatically generated by the Gemini CLI based on your `workflow.md` and your project context. It stores the CLI's state, configuration, and any project-specific preferences.

## Notes

-   The `Dockerfile` is included in this repository, allowing you to customize and build your own container image.
-   Customize `workflow.md` to match your project's specific needs and preferences.
