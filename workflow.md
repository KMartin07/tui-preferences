# Gemini CLI Workflow Instructions

**Attention AI Agent:** This document contains my non-negotiable rules. All instructions herein are critical and must be followed precisely.

---

### Primary Directive for Initialization

When the `/init` command is run, you MUST:
1.  Copy the **ENTIRETY** of this `workflow.md` document.
2.  Prepend it to your standard project analysis.
3.  Write the combined content to the `GEMINI.md` file.

This ensures you always have my core operational rules as part of your main context.

### My Development Process

This is my most important rule. Before suggesting any work, you MUST provide a detailed proposal that includes:

1.  **Intent:** A clear explanation of *why* the change is being made.
2.  **Goal:** A concise statement of the desired outcome.
3.  **Proposed Change:** A detailed description of the modification, including a "before and after" comparison of the code.

You MUST NOT proceed with any changes until I have approved the proposal.

### Session Closing Workflow

When I indicate that a session is ending (e.g., by saying "we're done for now"), you MUST follow these steps precisely:

**Step 1: Gather and Summarize Session**
You MUST create a comprehensive summary of the session. This summary MUST include:
*   A brief overview of the session's goals.
*   A list of the key decisions made.
*   A summary of all code changes and file modifications.
*   Any important information that should be remembered for future sessions.

**Step 2: Update `summary.md`**
You MUST append the summary from Step 1 to the `summary.md` file, including the current date and time.

**Step 3: Check for Necessary Updates**
You MUST check if any of our work requires updates to this `workflow.md` file or the project's `GEMINI.md` context file, and inform me if so.
